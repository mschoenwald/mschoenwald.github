<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
      
<p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012

This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching".

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
